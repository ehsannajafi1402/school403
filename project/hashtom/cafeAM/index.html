                degrees, depending on the desired aroma and taste, different degrees of baking are considered for this

        named Jerry Baldwin, a history teacher named Zoe Siegel, and a writer named Gordon Booker, who met at the

        where coffee beans and various related equipment were sold was a person named Alfred Peet who taught them how to
        roast coffee. This store located in Pike Place neighborhood is still active.
        In 1982, the original founder of this company, Howard Schultz, joined the partners with the offer to sell
        espresso and coffee. At that time, most people believed that coffee should only be prepared in people's homes;
        Therefore, Schultz's proposal was not accepted by the other three partners. According to them, entering the
        field of selling drinks would cause a deviation and prevent them from reaching their desired goal.
        In 1985, Schultz alone founded a chain of coffee shops under the name "Il Journale". In 1987, the owners of
        Starbucks handed over the franchise of their stores to Schultz. Schultz quickly merged these two collections and
        started expanding Starbucks coffee shops in different countries. The first Starbucks chain coffee shops were
        established in the same year in the cities of Chicago in America and Vancouver in Canada.
